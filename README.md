# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

This is my solution to Frontend Mentor's [QR code component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-ByDn_BTRr). The challenge involves creating a responsive QR code component that can be used on any website. ðŸ‘‹

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create this QR code component:
- HTML
- CSS
- React w/TypesScript


## My Process

Very simple static project. 

There was only a Â½ dozen elements and the style font, colors, and QR code image was provided. The challenge was in getting the CSS to match the formatting of the provided design. 

The only thing dynamic is that the width will change depending on whether itâ€™s viewed on a desktop of mobile. 


## Credits

I would like to thank Frontend Mentor for providing this challenge, as it allowed me to practice my frontend development skills.
